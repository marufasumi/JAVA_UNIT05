1.Linked Lists

The runtime complexity of the function depends on the length of the linked lists.
Let's assume the length of the first linked list is n and the length of the second linked list is m.

To calculate the sum, the function needs to traverse both linked lists simultaneously,
performing addition digit by digit. This process takes O(max(n, m)) time because the function
iterates over the longer linked list.

Therefore, the runtime complexity of this function is O(max(n, m)), where n and m are the lengths
of the input linked lists.

2.Sorting

Quick Sort and Merge Sort typically have better runtime efficiency compared to Insertion Sort.

Quick Sort has an average-case runtime complexity of O(n log n), which means it performs well on average
when sorting a large number of elements. In the best case scenario, Quick Sort can achieve a runtime
complexity of O(n log n) when the pivot element chosen during partitioning divides the input into roughly
equal halves. However, in the worst case scenario, Quick Sort can have a runtime complexity of O(n^2)
when the pivot element is consistently chosen as the smallest or largest element, resulting in highly
unbalanced partitions.

Merge Sort has a consistent runtime complexity of O(n log n) in all scenarios. It divides the input array
into smaller halves recursively, and then merges them back together in sorted order. This makes Merge
Sort a stable and efficient sorting algorithm. It is often preferred for sorting large datasets or when
stability is important.

Insertion Sort, on the other hand, has an average-case and worst-case runtime complexity of O(n^2).
It performs well for small input sizes or partially sorted arrays. In the best case scenario, when
the input array is already sorted, Insertion Sort can achieve a runtime complexity of O(n).

#3.RECURSION
The runtime complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the array. In the worst case,
the function needs to check every element in the array until it finds a match or reaches the end.
Therefore, the runtime grows linearly with the size of the array.
